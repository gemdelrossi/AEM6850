```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# Plan for today

1. For loops and *apply functions
3. Parallelization
4. Using lists effectively

---

# For loops and apply

* R various ways of repeating the same task multiple times
  - for: looping over an index
  - apply: looping over rows or columns of a matrix
  - lapply/sapply/mapply: looping over lists
  
  
---

# Parralell computing

* You can parallelize code in R
  - Similar syntax as lapply
  - parallel package
  - mclapply() does not work on Windows
  - parLapply() is another version
